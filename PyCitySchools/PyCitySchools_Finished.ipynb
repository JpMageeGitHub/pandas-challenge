    "Based on the delineation by categories such as spending per student, size, and type of school, there are some interesting conclusions we can draw about standardized performance. While logic might dictate that the smaller a school is, the more likely students will perform better thanks to smaller class sizes, that does not hold true here. In fact, the medium sized schools outperformed the small and the big schools by a comfortable margin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, spending per student does not seem to weigh as heavily as one might expect. In fact, the opposite is true. When the spending per student was under $548, these students had the highest performance in both averages for math and reading, and passing rates. A shortcoming of such a study is that we aren't diving into school culture, the faculty and leadership, and past performances. All of these would play a part in the success of a school, and aren't as easily measured numerically.\n",
